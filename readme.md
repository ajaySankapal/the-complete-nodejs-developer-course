##### Dynamic pages with templating

###### handlebars - by handlebars we can render dynamic content across various pages. Like if we want to display header and footer at each page, if we dont use dynamic content we have to copy paste the same code at every page. and if we want to change anything we have to make the changes at every page. so we use dynamic content at one place and use it at every page

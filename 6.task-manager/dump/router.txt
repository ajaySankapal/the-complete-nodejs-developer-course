//In task manager code there is a lot of code in the same file which can be slightly confusing.. we can have the separate router for our user and task

//create new router
const router = new express.Router();
router.get("/test", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from the other router!");
});

//this will not work unless we register it.. we can do so by -
app.use(router);
